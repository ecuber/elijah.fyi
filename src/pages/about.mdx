## Internships

### University at Buffalo
**Undergraduate Researcher** â€” *June 2023 - August 2023*

This summer, I'm doing an undergraduate research internship on-site in Buffalo, NY, where
I'm working on building a 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capture_the_flag_(cybersecurity)" target="_blank">CTF</a>
platform for a software security course. 

My specific project was to work on the backend infrastructure for the students' hacking sandboxes and implementing
new tools to help instructors monitor student activity and ensure academic honesty.

The main technologies I used for this project were Docker, Bash scripts, Python, and C.

### RelationalAI
**Software Engineering Intern** â€” *July 2022 - August 2022*

At [RAI](https://relational.ai), a database startup, I developed an graphic interface for visualizing and interacting
with data based on  [object role modeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93role_modeling). I implemented
and deployed my tool to a company training site for new users of the company's system.

I built the tool with TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS on top of the existing Next.js infrastructure.

### Brown University
**Research Assistant** â€” *June 2021 - September 2021*

In high school, I worked as an intern directly under a professor in the data science department at Brown. I worked on
creating a preliminary version of math authoring software that would allow math teachers to create visual and interactive
content for their students.

The vision was to lower the barrier to minimize code use and increase access to visualization techniques that had previously
had been restricted to teachers with programming ability.

I submitted a demo of this program (still available [here!](https://beautifuldatascience.netlify.app/)) to Grant Sanderson's
Summer of Math Exposition 2021 contest where we placed in the top 8% of 1300 entries.
